Here are the following steps to run this project locally. 

1. Get a valid version of Node. I am using Node Version Manager (nvm) using Node v24.2.0

2. 'cd' into NPMSupplyChain project folder and run 'npx expo start --clear'. It will ask you
    to download expo, say yes. 

3. This will automatically run npm install. If not run 'npm install' and make sure node modules 
    folder exists.


(Complete Step 4 or 5)

4. To run on your computer download a simulator. I the iOS simulator through XCode. This is the hardest step.
    See https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/ for detailed walk through.

5. To use on your phone. Dowload 'Expo Go' mobile app from Apple App store or Google Play.

6. In the project folder run 'npx expo start --clear'. You should see a lot of output including a 
    QR code. If you are using the Expo Go mobile app scan the QR code that appears in the terminal. 
    This will open the app on your device. 

    If you are using a simulator press 'i' in the terminal. This will automatically start the project in 
    the simulator.
